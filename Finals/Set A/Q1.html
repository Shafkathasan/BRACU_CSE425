Consider the above classification of patterns. The training set consists of
patterns A and B in all possible translations. Consider a neural network that
consists of a 1D convolution layer with a linear activation function, followed
by a linear layer with a logistic output. Can such an architecture perfectly
classify all of the training examples? Why or why not? <br /><br />

  A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize
  underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the
  way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems
  of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best
  possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept
  of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly
  gaining popularity in the development of trading systems.

  Neural networks, in the world of finance, assist in the development of such
  processes as time-series forecasting, algorithmic trading, securities
  classification, credit risk modeling, and constructing proprietary indicators
  and price derivatives.

  A neural network works similarly to the human brain&#8217;s neural network. A
  &#8220;neuron&#8221; in a neural network is a mathematical function that
  collects and classifies information according to a specific architecture. The
  network bears a strong resemblance to statistical methods such as curve
  fitting and regression analysis.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  A neural network contains layers of interconnected nodes. Each node is a known
  as perceptron and is similar to a multiple linear regression. The perceptron
  feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation
  function that may be nonlinear.<br />
  The architecture is perfectly fine for classification of pattern A and pattern
  B but the only problem arises is the number of training samples, for a neural
  network to learn much more samples would be required failing to which it
  wouldn't be able to give the required output.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Convolution layers are linear, and any composition of linear layers is still
  linear,We showed the classes are not linearly separable.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Because of which there would be testing samples where the pattern won't match
  A nor B and then the neural network might give a false output due to very less
  training.<br />

<p>Here is the answer for the above question:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Such an architecture will not be able to perfectly classify all of the
  training examples.Because convolution layers are linear and any composition of
  linear layers are also linear.And the classes are not linearly separable.So
  the answer is <strong>NO</strong>
